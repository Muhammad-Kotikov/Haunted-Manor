# Haunted-Manor

it's the most fun game, I promise

## Hardware Requirements

- NOT Sidney's shitty macbook
- however, if you DO have a low spec pc, you can turn off the lightsystem and (but this should be unnecessary) the crt shader, may not look as pretty

## Software Requirements
- OS: any (tested with Windows, MacOS and Debian)
- Python (version 3.11.2 tested, older versions may don't work)
- Pygame module (version 2.3.0 or newer)
- NumPy module (tested with version 1.24.2, around that should be totally fine)
